# RopeSwinging3D
Unity game with two-handed physics-based rope swinging through a small city

My aim is to use ragdoll physics and physics based ropes to create a fun traversal mechanic from which more game modes can be created, like multiplayer swinging races or missions. The rope swinging uses raycasting and configured joints while the player ragdoll requires work for movement other than swinging.
